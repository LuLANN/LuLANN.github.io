    <p>A short fiction piece that was a finalist in the 2019 HeforShe Writing Contest at UWaterloo about how the sins of the father often are passed down and suffered by their children, a theme I first learned
      in my Gr.12 English class when we were studying Gibsen's A Doll's House. I remember that Friday evening in the fall of 2019 when I heard about this contest
    and spent that entire evening working on it. At first, I wasn't sure how to put my ideas together so I actually wrote an essay that explained my take on this theme.
 That step really helped put the story together. I think what helped sell my piece was the spacing between each of the lines since it gave the writing a sense of movement as the story progressed.  </p>
