    <h3>The Pyramid</h3>
    <p>A short fiction piece that was a finalist in the 2019 HeforShe Writing Contest at UWaterloo. The piece contemplates how consequences from past conflicts within a family can be passed down from parents to their children, a theme I had encountered
      during my Gr.12 English class when we were studying Ibsen's A Doll's House. I remember that Friday evening in the fall of 2019 when I heard about this contest
    and spent that entire evening working on it. I think what helped sell my piece was the spacing between each of the lines since it gave the writing a sense of movement as the story progressed.
 I also added a biblical reference since they show up all the time in literature. </p>
